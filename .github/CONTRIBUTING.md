Contributing to Amorvia

Thanks for helping build Amorvia! This guide explains how to set up your environment, the data/schema rules, how we test, and our commit/PR workflow.

Prerequisites

Node.js 22.x (CI runs on 22)

npm (ships with Node)

macOS, Linux, or Codespaces

Tip: in Codespaces, everything below ‚ÄúQuick start‚Äù should just work.

Quick start
# install dependencies (clean slate)
npm ci

# optional: one-time dev setup (http-server, etc)
npm run setup:dev

# run schema conversion + lint (validates all v2 files)
npm run fix:schemas    # alias for convert + lint

# run the smoke e2e
npm run test:e2e:spec -- cypress/e2e/_smoke_all_scenarios.cy.js


We use Husky pre-commit hooks. On commit, the hook will:

convert JSON to v2, 2) lint schemas (AJV), 3) run the repo-wide smoke check.

If your commit fails, fix the reported errors and commit again.

Project scripts
# validate all v2 scenario jsons against the schema
npm run lint:schemas

# CI-friendly validator (used in GitHub Action)
npm run lint:schemas:ci

# v2 structure checks/fixes (tools)
npm run convert:v2
npm run convert:v2:dry

# content tools (effects, hints, neutral fills)
npm run choices:scan
npm run choices:hint
npm run choices:hint:write
npm run choices:neutral
npm run choices:neutral:write

# e2e tests
npm run test:e2e               # all e2e with Electron
npm run test:e2e:spec -- <spec>
npm run test:e2e:open          # interactive (xvfb in CI)

# quick CI-like lane used by Husky/CI
npm run ci:lean                # lint + repo-wide smoke

Schema & data model (v2)

All scenarios live in public/data/*.v2.json

Must validate against public/schema/scenario.v2.schema.json

Required top-level fields:

id (string), title (string), version: 2, meters (object), acts (array)

Allowed meters: trust, tension, childStress

Choice effects must use only these meters

Each delta must be within -2 ‚Ä¶ +2 (schema and tests enforce this)

Acts/steps

acts[].id unique

acts[].steps[] is an array

each step has id, display text (one of text|label|prompt|title|description|desc), and choices[] (min 2)

each choice has id, label, to, effects (object of deltas)

to can point to a step id, an act id (jump to act‚Äôs first step), or "menu" (terminal)

Converters & fixers

npm run convert:v2 makes sure old/loose formats meet v2 shape.

npm run fix:display-text (and the fix pass bundled in CI lanes) ensures every step has a display text field.

Writing scenarios

Put your file in public/data/<scenario-name>.v2.json

Use globally unique step ids (e.g., a1s1, a1s2, a2s1, ‚Ä¶)

Provide 2+ choices per step, with human-readable label

Use only the allowed meters with deltas in [-2, 2]

Use "menu" for terminal nodes or jump to another step/act by id

Keep narrative strings concise; long text goes in text/description

Before committing:

npm run convert:v2
npm run lint:schemas
npm run test:e2e:spec -- cypress/e2e/_smoke_all_scenarios.cy.js

Testing
Smoke (repo-wide)

Catches common issues across all scenarios:

npm run test:e2e:spec -- cypress/e2e/_smoke_all_scenarios.cy.js

Full validation for the main scenario
npm run test:e2e:spec -- cypress/e2e/dating_after_breakup_full.cy.js


This suite checks:

top-level fields and version: 2

choice to pointers resolve

only known meters with safe deltas

graph reachability (non-first steps must be referenced)

random playthrough keeps cumulative meters clamped

Run all e2e
npm run test:e2e


In CI we use Electron headless. Local interactive (open) is supported as well.

Commit & PR workflow
Pre-commit hook (Husky)

On each commit we run:

convert:v2 ‚Üí lint:schemas ‚Üí smoke e2e


If any step fails, the commit aborts.

We intentionally do not call the legacy husky.sh. The repo uses a no-bootstrap script and core.hooksPath is set to .husky/.

Conventional commits

Use prefixes like:

feat: ‚Ä¶ new content/tools

fix: ‚Ä¶ bug/data fix

chore: ‚Ä¶ tooling, deps, CI

docs: ‚Ä¶ docs only

test: ‚Ä¶ tests

PR template

When you open a PR, GitHub pre-populates a checklist (tests, schema validation, scenario notes). Please keep it up to date.

CI

We run GitHub Actions on every push/PR:

Node 22 with npm cache

convert:v2, lint:schemas

Cypress (Electron headless) on selected specs

Branch protection is recommended so main only accepts CI-green PRs.

Troubleshooting

AJV not found

Ensure devDependencies are installed: npm ci

Use the provided scripts (they resolve the local binary)

Cypress DBus warnings (Electron)

You may see Failed to connect to the bus‚Ä¶ in headless Linux ‚Äî it‚Äôs harmless in our setup.

‚Äúglob does not provide default export‚Äù

We use import { glob } from 'glob' (ESM). If you write tools, prefer named import.

Husky deprecation warning

Don‚Äôt source husky.sh. Our .husky/pre-commit is self-contained. If you see the warning, remove:

#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"


Pre-commit takes too long

Use npm run ci:lean locally for quick checks.

If you‚Äôre iterating, commit smaller chunks or run scripts directly.

Branch is behind remote

git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
git push --force-with-lease
