Amorvia — All Acts (1–4) for Beta Scenarios — 2025-08-19

This package provides complete 4-act versions of the 5 beta scenarios, plus two extras.
Each act has a short branchy path that converges to a single end node, with meter shifts kept modest.

Updated files:
- co-parenting-with-bipolar-partner.v2.json
- dating-after-breakup-with-child-involved.v2.json
- step-parenting-conflicts.v2.json
- cultural-or-religious-difference.v2.json
- lgbtq-relationship-challenges.v2.json
- (extras) different-rules.v2.json, scene-first-agreements.v2.json
- v2-index.json (beta list unchanged)

Install
1) Copy /public/data/* into your project's /public/data/ (overwrite).
2) Deploy. Your SW will auto-refresh; reload once to fetch fresh content.

Notes
- If you already authored rich Act 1 content, you can merge it back—these files contain a minimal Act 1 stub to keep structure consistent.
- Run your validator if available; node references have been validated in this bundle.
- Meters are within ±10 to ±15 per hop; engine should clamp to [0,100] if needed.
