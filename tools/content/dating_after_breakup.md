# Dating After Breakup (With Child Involved)

## Act 1 — First Date
- You decide to meet someone new for coffee.
- Your child is staying with your ex.
- Do you tell your ex about this date or keep it private?

## Act 2 — Introducing the Idea
- A few weeks later, your child overhears you talking on the phone with the new person.
- Your child asks: “Who is that?”
- Choices: be honest but gentle, change the subject, or dismiss it quickly.

## Act 3 — First Reactions
- Your ex finds out that you’ve started dating.
- They confront you — either calmly, defensively, or angrily.
- You can choose to: reassure them that your child’s needs come first, argue, or refuse to discuss.

## Act 4 — Resolution
- Depending on your decisions:
  - **Positive path:** Your ex accepts your right to move on, your child feels secure, and boundaries are set.  
  - **Neutral path:** Tensions remain but are manageable.  
  - **Negative path:** Conflict worsens, child feels caught in the middle, and co-parenting suffers.
