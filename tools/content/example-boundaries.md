# Setting Boundaries After a Busy Week

## Act 1 — Tension
- You’ve both had a long week. Messages were short and a bit snappy.
- Partner: "We need to talk tonight."
- You: "I’m exhausted, can we pick a calmer time?"

## Act 2 — Reflection
- You suggest taking a short walk before talking.
- Partner: "Okay… I guess I could use some fresh air too."

## Act 3 — Conversation
- You: "When texts get short, I feel distance. I need clarity, not guesswork."
- Partner: "I get overwhelmed and shut down. I don’t want that to push you away."

## Act 4 — Agreement
- You agree on a "pause signal" when messages get tense and to revisit later.
- Both: "We’ll check in tomorrow to see how it felt."
