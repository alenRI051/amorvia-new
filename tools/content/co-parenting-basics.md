# Scene: First Agreements
You're setting the ground rules post-split. Choose your approach:

- **Mediation-first:** Seek a neutral mediator to draft a parenting plan.
- **DIY plan:** Draft a plan and validate with a social worker.
- **Lawyered:** Each side retains counsel for a formal agreement.

> Tip: Keep the child's routine stable (sleep, meals, daycare).

## Decision Checkpoints
1. Handovers (location, time, lateness policy)
2. Communication channel (app, email, SMS)
3. Health & school information sharing
