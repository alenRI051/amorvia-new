# Co-Parenting with Bipolar Partner

## Act 1 — First Exchange
- You arrive to pick up your child, but your ex seems upset.
- They start speaking in a confusing or emotional way.
- You must choose whether to stay calm, ignore the behavior, or respond emotionally.

## Act 2 — Escalation
- The discussion grows tense, and your ex raises their voice.
- Your child notices the tension and becomes unsettled.
- Options appear: de-escalate with soothing words, suggest a short break, or argue back.

## Act 3 — Resolution
- Depending on choices, you either reach a small compromise, leave things unresolved, or make the situation worse.
- If you stayed calm, your child feels reassured.
- If you escalated, the conflict lingers and your child feels stressed.
